## Translating Screensy to other languages
If you'd like to translate Screensy to a new language, here's what you should do:

1. Make sure the language you want to translate Screensy into is supported by the Chrome Store. [Here's a list](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/i18n/#choosing-locales-to-support) of all the supported locales.
2. Create a new folder under [_locales](https://github.com/allaboutishaan/screensy/tree/master/_locales) with the [locale name for your language](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/i18n/#choosing-locales-to-support).
3. Make a copy of [this file](https://github.com/allaboutishaan/screensy/blob/master/_locales/en/messages.json) and translate the "message". The "description" shouldn't be translated, it's only there to give you some context where the string will show in the extension.
4. Translate the [Chrome Store description](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screensy-screen-recorder/kdabkldmfdgpcmgdmhbalcljffbfamia?hl=en&authuser=0) so it can be published there, you can simply make a comment with it when you make a pull request. 

Before submitting the pull request, it would be helpful if you tried running the extension in the new language, to make sure everything looks right.

## Self-hosting Screensy
You can run Screensy locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here's how:

1. Download the code. In the web version of GitHub, you can do that by clicking the green "Code" button, and then "Download ZIP".
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser, and [enable developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
3. Drag the folder that contains the code (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
4. That's it, you will now be able to use Screensy locally. Make sure you pin it on the toolbar by clicking the "puzzle" icon in the toolbar and pinning Screensy.
